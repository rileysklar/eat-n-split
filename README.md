# ðŸ§¾ SplitTab

ðŸ§¾ SplitTab is a React-based application designed to make dining out with friends easier by calculating how to split the bill fairly. Whether you're sharing a pizza or a gourmet meal, our app takes into account what each person ordered and suggests how to divide the cost efficiently, including tax and tip.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React for its component-based architecture, making our app scalable and maintainable.
- **Node.js**: Our development environment. Node.js allows us to use JavaScript on the server-side, providing the necessary tools to run and manage our React application.
- **State Management**: We use React's built-in state management to handle user inputs and calculations. This keeps the app responsive and ensures that the UI always reflects the latest data.
- **CSS**: For styling, we keep things simple and responsive with CSS, making sure ðŸ§¾ SplitTab looks good on any device.
